If you're running Windows/OSX install [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox)
  
## Run Demo
with docker & docker-compose installed & configured you have everything you need to run this demo.

after the project is cloned, navigate to the project root directory in the terminal and type the following command

`docker-compose up`
